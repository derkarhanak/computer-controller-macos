# Computer Controller - macOS AI Assistant v1.1.0

A modern, open-source macOS application that allows you to control your computer using natural language. The app supports multiple AI providers (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude, Groq, Ollama) to generate Python code for file operations and other computer tasks, with built-in safety confirmations.

**ðŸš€ NEW in v1.1.0: Groq Integration with lightning-fast inference!**

## Usage Examples

### File Operations

**Move files:**
```
"Move all PDF files from Downloads to Documents folder"
```

**Rename files:**
```
"Rename all image files in Pictures folder to include today's date"
```

**Create directories:**
```
"Create a backup folder in Documents and copy all important files there"
```

**Clean up:**
```
"Delete all empty folders in Downloads directory"
```

### How It Works

1. **Input**: Describe what you want to do in natural language
2. **AI Generation**: DeepSeek generates appropriate Python code
3. **Review**: Review the generated code and operation description
4. **Confirm**: Confirm the operation before execution
5. **Execute**: The app runs the Python code safely
6. **Results**: See the results and any output

## Safety Features

- **Code Validation**: Checks for potentially dangerous operations
- **User Confirmation**: Always requires confirmation before execution
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Runs Python code in a controlled environment
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **File System Limits**: Restricted to safe file operations only

## ðŸš€ Groq Integration (v1.1.0)

### **Why Groq?**
- **Ultra-fast inference** (often 10x faster than traditional GPUs)
- **LPU Technology** for lightning-fast response times
- **High-quality models** including GPT-OSS 20B
- **Cost-effective** with generous free tier
- **OpenAI-compatible API** for seamless integration

### **Available Groq Models**
- `openai/gpt-oss-20b` - GPT-OSS 20B (default, recommended)
- `llama3-8b-8192` - Fast Llama 3 8B
- `llama3-70b-8192` - High-quality Llama 3 70B
- `mixtral-8x7b-32768` - Mixtral 8x7B
- `gemma2-9b-it` - Gemma 2 9B
- `llama2-70b-4096` - Llama 2 70B

## Architecture

The app is built with a clean, modular architecture:

- **ContentView**: Main tab-based interface
- **MainOperationView**: AI-powered computer control interface
- **FileOperationView**: Settings and quick file operations
- **LLMService**: Multi-provider AI integration (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude, Groq, Ollama)
- **PythonExecutor**: Safe Python code execution
- **FileManager Extensions**: Additional file operation utilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not Connected" Status:**
- Ensure you've entered your DeepSeek API key correctly
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits

**Code Execution Errors:**
- Make sure Python 3.x is installed (usually included with macOS)
- Check that the requested files/directories exist
- Ensure you have proper permissions for the target locations

**Build Errors:**
- Make sure you're using Xcode 15.0 or later
- Verify macOS 14.0+ target
- Check that all Swift files are included in the project

### Permissions

The app may request access to:
- **Full Disk Access**: Required for file operations across the system
- **Network Access**: Required for DeepSeek API communication

## Development

### Adding New Features

The app is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **New LLM Models**: Modify `LLMService.swift` to support additional providers
2. **Additional Operations**: Extend `PythonExecutor.swift` for new operation types
3. **UI Enhancements**: Add new views and integrate them into the tab system

### Code Style

- Follow SwiftUI best practices
